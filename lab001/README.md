# Lab 001: Setting up GitHub

### Points: 100

In order to store your work, you'll create a GitHub account. GitHub is a
very popular website for storing `git` repositories. `git` is a "version control
system," which means a system that stores your code, keeps it safe, and helps
you keep track of the changes you make to it.

## Create your GitHub account

Go to the [signup page](https://github.com/join) and create an account. Use
a professional-looking username, as this may end up being your "real" GitHub
account you use as a professional software developer!
