# Lab 002: Forking the HomeLabs repo

### Points: 100

A respository on GitHub can be "forked," which means you can make a copy of it.
When you create a fork, you get a complete copy of the repository, including all
of its history (list of changes ever made to it), and you can "merge", or sync,
changes from the original repo into your private copy.

If you don't understand that yet, don't worry. You won't need to do any of this
"merge" business for a while, and when you do, we'll be sure to explain it to you.

## Fork the HomeLabs repo

In order to work on your labs, you'll make a fork of the HomeLabs repo. This way,
you can add ("commit") the code you write directly to the repo alongside the
instructions, keeping everything nice and organized as you complete the labs.

1. Navigate to the HomeLabs repo on GitHub by [clicking here](https://github.com/smxlong/HomeLabs)
2. Find the button in the upper right that says "Fork" and click it.
3. Follow the directions to create the fork.

When you are done, you'll have your very own copy of these labs, on GitHub,
ready for you to work on. You'll be able to find your fork in your repository
list on GitHub. To see your repositories, go to this URL (substitute your user
name in the place shown):

`https://github.com/<YOUR USERNAME>?tab=repositories`
