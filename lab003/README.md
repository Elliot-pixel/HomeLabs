# Lab 003: Editing a file on GitHub

### Points: 25

Usually, you edit code and other files on your own computer, and then upload
("push") those changes to GitHub when you are ready. But GitHub also lets
you edit files directly on the GitHub website.

## Edit this file

To earn 25 easy points, edit this file and add your signature to the bottom.

1. Find the pencil icon and click it. This file will open inside an editor.
2. Scroll to the bottom of the editor and add the following line:
   `### Signed <today's date> by <your name>`
3. Find the form at the bottom that says **Commit new file**
4. Enter a message into the top box that says `Adding my signature`
5. Press the `Commit changes` button

You should see the screen refresh and you'll be looking at this file again,
this time, with your signature on the bottom!

> HINT: Now that you know how to edit a file, you can edit the main
> [README.md](../README.md) file to mark off which labs you've completed,
> and keep track of your total points earned!
