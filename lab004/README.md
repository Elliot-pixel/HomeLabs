# Lab 004: Cloning your HomeLabs fork onto your computer

### Points: 100

Now that we know that GitHub can be used to edit files directly, let's
download ("clone") the repo onto your workstation (developers often call
their computer a "workstation") so we can work on it easily.

## Clone HomeLabs

1. Open a VSCode window.
2. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P` to open the command palette.
3. Type `Clone`. A single option should appear called `Git: Clone`
4. Select `Git: Clone`
5. In the box that says `Provider repository URL`, type the URL to your fork of the HomeLabs
   repo. This will be something like `https://github.com/<YOUR USERNAME>/HomeLabs`.
6. A window will pop up letting you choose where to clone to repo on your workstation.
   Pick a location that is convenient for you, like your home directory.
7. VSCode will clone the repository.
8. A window will appear asking if you want to open the repository you just cloned. Click on
   the button to open it.

Once you've cloned the repo, this is where all work will happen from now on, on your
workstation.
